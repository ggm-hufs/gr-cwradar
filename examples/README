#It is considered good practice to add examples in here to demonstrate the

#code can go here.

#This folder includes  the implemented systems using the created singal processing blocks.
#The final applications have are those named ~_App.py. To run them simply type:

#For CW Radar Single Target type:
$ sudo ./CW_Radar_Single_Target_App.py

#This folder also includes the GRC flow graphs.
#The file python_tweak_code contains the modified python code from the CRG generated python code 
#and the ~_App.py code.
